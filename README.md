# Thoughtbox

Thoughtbox is an app that accepts user input of up to 1200 characters long and submits them to a database. Each input is called a thought (thoughts are valuable commodities). 

This is a web app designed for those who want to collect people's anonymous thoughts on anything and everything. Alternatively, it can be used for entities who would like anonymous feedback.

The app is mobile-ready. Specify your database as an enivironment variable to make the app your own.

Find the app deployed [here](https://thotbox.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. Your thoughts will be submitted to the creator's database.

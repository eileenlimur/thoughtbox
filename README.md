# Thoughtbox

Thoughtbox is an app that presents an input box to accept user thoughts of up to 1200 characters long and submits them to a database. It is a web app designed for those who would like to collect people's anonymous thoughts. Alternatively, it can be used for entities who would like anonymous feedback.

The app is mobile-ready. Specify your database in the process.env to make the app your own.
